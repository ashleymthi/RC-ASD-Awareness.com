          <h1 class="page-tite">What is Autismn Spectrum Disorder</h1>
          <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental condition that involves  persistent challenges  in social interaction, speech and nonverbal communication, and restricted/repetitive behaviors. The effects of  ASD and the severity of symptoms are different in each person.</p>
          <p>ASD is usually first diagnosed in childhood with many of the most-obvious signs presenting around 2-3 years old, but some children with autism develop normally until toddlerhood when they stop acquiring or lose previously gained skills.</p>
          <p>According to the CDC, one in 59 children is estimated to have autism.  Autism spectrum disorder is also three to four times more common in boys than in girls, and many girls with ASD exhibit less obvious signs compared to boys. Autism is a lifelong condition.</p>
          <p>However, many children diagnosed with ASD go on to live independent, productive, and fulfilling lives. The information here focuses primarily on children and adolescents.</p>

          <h1>Characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorders</h1>
          <p>Autism differs from person to person in severity and combinations of symptoms. There is a great range of abilities and characteristics of children with autism spectrum disorder — no two children appear or behave the same way. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and often change over time.</p>

          <h2>Characteristics of autism spectrum disorder fall into two categories.</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Social interaction and communication problems: including difficulties in normal back-and-forth conversation, reduced sharing of interests or emotions, challenges in understanding or responding to social cues such as eye contact and facial expressions, deficits in developing/maintaining/understanding relationships (trouble making friends), and others.</p></li>
            <li><p>Restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviors, interests or activities:
hand-flapping and toe-walking, playing with toys in an uncommon way (such as lining up cars or flipping objects), speaking in a unique way (such as using odd patterns or pitches in speaking or “scripting” from favorite shows), having significant need for a predictable routine or structure, exhibiting intense interests in activities that are uncommon for a similarly aged child, experiencing the sensory aspects of the world in an unusual or extreme way (such as indifference to pain/temperature, excessive smelling/touching of objects, fascination with lights and movement, being overwhelmed with loud noises, etc), and others. </p></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Also, while many people with autism have normal intelligence, many others have mild or significant intellectual delays. Additionally, people with ASD are at greater risk for some medical conditions such as sleep problems, seizures and mental illnesses.</p>

            <h1>Autism Spectrum Disorder Experiences difficulties:</h1>
            <h3>Attention</h3>
            <p>-	Children who suffer with the ASD cannot be able to pay attention and it is difficult for them to pay attention, especially with an application that has too much extras added onto it in terms of too much visuals added on to it especially when they launch into the application.</p>
            <p>-	However, this can be alleviated by creating a simple application with less distracting visual animations which can be able to help the children be able to concentrate at the task that is supposed to be helping them learn all they have to learn.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="dark">
                <h3>Perception</h3>
                <p>-	The issue of perception is that the children who suffer from ASD are able to see, hear and be aware of somethings through senses whereby they have the ability to feel whether their parents are there or not.</p>
                <p>-	Companies can help with building an application which can keep them busy if the parents need to go to work or go out to buy some essentials for the house.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="dark">
                <h3>Learning</h3>
                <p>-	Learning can be a very tough challenge because they cannot remain still for longer periods of time as they’d want to play around and that makes it difficult to get them to concentrate on learning.</p>
                <p>-	The application will help in that situation as they’ll ask for a device that they use for the application and it can get them to concentrate on learning how to be able to speak and pronounce words. The applications are an essential for all learning because it can help the children pronounce words.</p>
