          <h1 class="page-tite">About Us</h1>
          <p>We are an independent Non-governmental Organisation(NGO) that deals in the awareness of Autism Spectrum Disorder. It has been discovered that more and more people with autism spectrum disorder do not recieve the required aid associated with their diabilities that often occur with autism spectrum disorder.</p>
          <p>while many people with autism have normal intelligence, many others have mild or significant intellectual delays. Additionally, people with ASD are at greater risk for some medical conditions such as sleep problems, seizures and mental illnesses.</p>
          <p>Therefore, diagnosis and treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder is best, in order to discover how each and every individual that suffers from autism spectrum disorder is to be assessed and treated, so they to may enjoy the joys of life in society.</p>

          <h1>Diagnosis and Risk Factors:</h1>
          <p>Early diagnosis and treatment are important to reducing the symptoms of autism and improving the quality of life for people with autism and their families. There is no medical test for autism. It is diagnosed based on observing how the child talks and acts in comparison to other children of the same age. Trained professionals typically diagnose autism by talking with the child and asking questions of parents and other caregivers.</p>
          <p>Under federal law, any child suspected of having a developmental disorder can get a free evaluation. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children be screened for developmental disorders at well-child preventive visits before age three.</p>

          <h1>Tips For Parents:</h1>

            <h1>Autism Spectrum Disorder Experiences difficulties:</h1>
            <h3>Attention</h3>
            <p>-	Children who suffer with the ASD cannot be able to pay attention and it is difficult for them to pay attention, especially with an application that has too much extras added onto it in terms of too much visuals added on to it especially when they launch into the application.</p>
            <p>-	However, this can be alleviated by creating a simple application with less distracting visual animations which can be able to help the children be able to concentrate at the task that is supposed to be helping them learn all they have to learn.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="dark">
                <h3>Perception</h3>
                <p>-	The issue of perception is that the children who suffer from ASD are able to see, hear and be aware of somethings through senses whereby they have the ability to feel whether their parents are there or not.</p>
                <p>-	Companies can help with building an application which can keep them busy if the parents need to go to work or go out to buy some essentials for the house.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="dark">
                <h3>Learning</h3>
                <p>-	Learning can be a very tough challenge because they cannot remain still for longer periods of time as they’d want to play around and that makes it difficult to get them to concentrate on learning.</p>
                <p>-	The application will help in that situation as they’ll ask for a device that they use for the application and it can get them to concentrate on learning how to be able to speak and pronounce words. The applications are an essential for all learning because it can help the children pronounce words.</p>
