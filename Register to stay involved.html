            <h1>Autism Spectrum Disorder Experiences difficulties:</h1>
            <h3>Attention</h3>
            <p>-	Children who suffer with the ASD cannot be able to pay attention and it is difficult for them to pay attention, especially with an application that has too much extras added onto it in terms of too much visuals added on to it especially when they launch into the application.</p>
            <p>-	However, this can be alleviated by creating a simple application with less distracting visual animations which can be able to help the children be able to concentrate at the task that is supposed to be helping them learn all they have to learn.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="dark">
                <h3>Perception</h3>
                <p>-	The issue of perception is that the children who suffer from ASD are able to see, hear and be aware of somethings through senses whereby they have the ability to feel whether their parents are there or not.</p>
                <p>-	Companies can help with building an application which can keep them busy if the parents need to go to work or go out to buy some essentials for the house.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="dark">
                <h3>Learning</h3>
                <p>-	Learning can be a very tough challenge because they cannot remain still for longer periods of time as they’d want to play around and that makes it difficult to get them to concentrate on learning.</p>
                <p>-	The application will help in that situation as they’ll ask for a device that they use for the application and it can get them to concentrate on learning how to be able to speak and pronounce words. The applications are an essential for all learning because it can help the children pronounce words.</p>
